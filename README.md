# Brave Browser Formula
Sets up, configures and updates Brave Browser.

## Usage
Applying `tool-brave` will make sure `brave` is configured as specified.

### Differences From Google Chrome Formula
This formula mostly behaves exactly like tool-chrome. One exception is Brave Browser's rather **obtrusive behavior** on the first startup asking if you want to make it your default browser - when you kill the application, the application popup will transform into a system popup instead of vanish (wtf â€“ on MacOS, at least). This made me reconsider writing this formula for a moment (ie, stopped me from using Brave Browser). Please don't get on my nerves. Killing the application should be taken as a sign. [This](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/12203) [was](https://community.brave.com/t/stop-brave-asking-to-be-my-default-browser/212793/5) [supposedly](https://community.brave.com/t/how-to-disable-default-browser-check/213614) [even](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/14502) [worse](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/14469) on initial launch of this feature. Why not ask nicely inside the window like every other browser instead of a blocking popup?

This will only manifest during the run of this formula if you specify flags (because the default profile needs to have been generated to add them).

### Brave Browser Specifics
#### Group Policies
There are [no official GPO ADML/X templates](https://github.com/Prowler2/Brave-Browser-GPO-Policy) for Windows currently. The inofficial ones have been added to this formula as a submodule, which will [not work with GitFS currently](https://github.com/saltstack/salt/issues/13664). Make sure to provide them.

In addition to default Chromium settings, Brave Browser also supports the following policy settings:
- TorDisabled
- IPFSEnabled

## Configuration
### Pillar
#### General `tool` architecture
Since installing user environments is not the primary use case for saltstack, the architecture is currently a bit awkward. All `tool` formulas assume running as root. There are three scopes of configuration:
1. per-user `tool`-specific
  > e.g. generally force usage of XDG dirs in `tool` formulas for this user
2. per-user formula-specific
  > e.g. setup this tool with the following configuration values for this user
3. global formula-specific (All formulas will accept `defaults` for `users:username:formula` default values in this scope as well.)
  > e.g. setup system-wide configuration files like this

**3** goes into `tool:formula` (e.g. `tool:git`). Both user scopes (**1**+**2**) are mixed per user in `users`. `users` can be defined in `tool:users` and/or `tool:formula:users`, the latter taking precedence. (**1**) is namespaced directly under `username`, (**2**) is namespaced under `username: {formula: {}}`.

```yaml
tool:
######### user-scope 1+2 #########
  users:                         #
    username:                    #
      xdg: true                  #
      dotconfig: true            #
      formula:                   #
        config: value            #
####### user-scope 1+2 end #######
  formula:
    formulaspecificstuff:
      conf: val
    defaults:
      yetanotherconfig: somevalue
######### user-scope 1+2 #########
    users:                       #
      username:                  #
        xdg: false               #
        formula:                 #
          otherconfig: otherval  #
####### user-scope 1+2 end #######
```

#### User-specific
The following shows an example of `tool-brave` pillar configuration. Namespace it to `tool:users` and/or `tool:brave:users`.
```yaml
user:
  brave:
    flags:    # Enable Brave Browser flags via Local State file.
              # To find the correct syntax, it is best to set them
              # and look inside "Local State" (json) browser:enabled_labs_experiments.
              # chrome://version will show an overview of enabled flags in the cli version
              # chrome://flags shows available flags and highlights those different from default
              # mind that cli switches will not be detected on that page
      - disable-accelerated-2d-canvas
      - enable-javascript-harmony
      - enable-webrtc-hide-local-ips-with-mdns@1
```

#### Formula-specific
```yaml
tool:
  brave:
    version: stable                        # stable, beta, nightly (dev was merged with beta)
    # When using policies.json on Linux, there are two global policy directories, therefore these
    # settings have to be global there. User-specific settings with policies are possible on MacOS
    # afaik where policies are installed via a profile.
