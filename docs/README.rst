Brave Browser Formula
=====================

Manages Brave Browser in the user environment.

Usage
-----
Applying ``tool_brave`` will make sure ``brave`` is configured as specified.

Differences From Google Chrome Formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This formula mostly behaves almost exactly like ``tool_chrome``. One exception is Brave Browser's rather **obtrusive behavior** on the first startup asking if you want to make it your default browser - when you kill the application, the application popup will transform into a system popup instead of vanish (wtf â€“ on MacOS, at least). This made me reconsider writing this formula for a moment (ie, stopped me from using Brave Browser). Please don't get on my nerves. Killing the application should be taken as a sign. `This <https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/12203>`_ `was <https://community.brave.com/t/stop-brave-asking-to-be-my-default-browser/212793/5>`_ `supposedly <https://community.brave.com/t/how-to-disable-default-browser-check/213614>`_ `even <https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/14502>`_ `worse <https://github.com/brave/brave-browser/issues/14469>`_ on initial launch of this feature. Why not ask nicely inside the window like every other browser instead of a blocking popup?

This will only manifest during the run of this formula if you specify flags (because the default profile needs to have been generated to add them).

Brave Browser Specifics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Group Policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There are `no official GPO ADML/X templates <https://github.com/Prowler2/Brave-Browser-GPO-Policy>`_ for Windows currently. Some `inofficial ones <https://github.com/Prowler2/Brave-Browser-GPO-Policy>`_ have been added to the default configuration of this formula for Windows. The installation of those might break at any point and require some tweaks to the configuration. See ``tool_brave/parameters/os_family/Windows.yaml`` for details.

In addition to default Chromium settings, Brave Browser also supports the following policy settings:

* TorDisabled
* IPFSEnabled

Configuration
-------------

This formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The general configuration structure is in line with all other formulae from the `tool` suite, for details see :ref:`toolsuite`. An example pillar is provided, see :ref:`pillar.example`. Note that you do not need to specify everything by pillar. Often, it's much easier and less resource-heavy to use the ``parameters/<grain>/<value>.yaml`` files for non-sensitive settings. The underlying logic is explained in :ref:`map.jinja`.

User-specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following shows an example of ``tool_brave`` per-user configuration. If provided by pillar, namespace it to ``tool_global:users`` and/or ``tool_brave:users``. For the ``parameters`` YAML file variant, it needs to be nested under a ``values`` parent key. The YAML files are expected to be found in

1. ``salt://tool_brave/parameters/<grain>/<value>.yaml`` or
2. ``salt://tool_global/parameters/<grain>/<value>.yaml``.

  user:

      # Force the usage of XDG directories for this user.
    xdg: true

      # Persist environment variables used by this formula for this
      # user to this file (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
    persistenv: '.config/zsh/zshenv'

      # Add runcom hooks specific to this formula to this file
      # for this user (will be appended to a file relative to $HOME)
    rchook: '.config/zsh/zshrc'

      # This user's configuration for this formula. Will be overridden by
      # user-specific configuration in `tool_brave:users`.
      # Set this to `false` to disable configuration for this user.
    brave:
        # Enable Brave Browser flags via Local State file. To find the correct syntax,
        # it is best to set them manually and look inside "Local State" (json)
        # `browser:enabled_labs_experiments`.
        # `chrome://version` will show an overview of enabled flags in the CLI variant
        # `chrome://flags` shows available flags and highlights
        # those different from default.
        # Mind that CLI switches will not be detected on that page.
      flags:
        - disable-accelerated-2d-canvas

Available states
----------------

The following states are found in this formula:

.. contents::
   :local:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Meta-state*.

Performs all operations described in this formula according to the specified configuration.


``tool_brave.package``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Installs the Brave Browser package only.

Commit messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Commit message formatting is significant.

Please see `How to contribute <https://github.com/saltstack-formulas/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_ for more details.

pre-commit
^^^^^^^^^^

`pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ is configured for this formula, which you may optionally use to ease the steps involved in submitting your changes.
First install  the ``pre-commit`` package manager using the appropriate `method <https://pre-commit.com/#installation>`_, then run ``bin/install-hooks`` and
now ``pre-commit`` will run automatically on each ``git commit``.

.. code-block:: console

  $ bin/install-hooks
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
  pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

State documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is a script that semi-autodocuments available states: ``bin/slsdoc``.

If a ``.sls`` file begins with a Jinja comment, it will dump that into the docs. It can be configured differently depending on the formula. See the script source code for details currently.

This means if you feel a state should be documented, make sure to write a comment explaining it.
