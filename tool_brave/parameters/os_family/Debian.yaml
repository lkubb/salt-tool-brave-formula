# rationale for signed-by directive (https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/UseThirdParty):
#     The reason we point to a file instead of a fingerprint is that the latter forces the user
#     to add the key to the global SecureApt trust anchor in /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d, which would
#     cause the system to accept signatures from the third-party keyholder on all other
#     repositories configured on the system that don't have a signed-by option
#     (including the official Debian repositories).
